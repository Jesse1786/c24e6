# Overloading Operators in Python

## Introduction
Overloading operators refers to giving an operator (such as +, -, or >) functionality beyond its default operational logic. For example, in Python the + operator is overloaded by the string class to concatenate the two strings. However, an error is raised if the operation hasn't been defined for two input types.


&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello " + "world!"  
"hello world!"  

&gt;&gt;&gt; "abc" + 5  
error!

## Purpose
Overloading operators is primarily done by the user when they want to define operators for user defined classes, and provides advantages such as making the code more readable and logical. 

For example, consider an user defined class called Vector, which represents a vector in Euclidean space. It would make sense for this class to have logic for operators such as addition and subtraction. When these operators are implemented in the Vector class, it is referred to as overloading operators. This is similar to how function overloading refers to how a function's behaviour is different depending on the type and number of parameters. 

### Vector Class Implementation

```
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, p1, p2):
        self.p1 = p1
        self.p2 = p2

    def __add__(self, other):
        return (self.p1 + other.p1, self.p2 + other.p2)

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return (self.p1 - other.p1, self.p2 - other.p2)
```
